Attempts to adjust mass values for ships in the game Endless Sky. Where mass governs acceleration and turning and drag limits max velocity, larger ships should have more mass so they accelerate slower than small ships... 

Work in progress...

See summary.txt for basic concepts.

End goal is to bass the mass of ships based on their stats, to a reasonable degree, where it is still fun to fly one. The idea is for each bunk, 100 fuel, Outfit space, Shield point, and Hull point the ship in question gains x amout of mass. See spreadsheet in repo, plugin is based off formulas there. (Numbers in green cells will change numbers for each ship.)
