	description "These crystals, mined on the Remnant planet Viminal, can store a surprising amount of power in a compact form. Crystals pure enough to be used in such a manner are hard to find, however."
	description "	The capacitors tend to leak small amounts of energy in the form of excess heat. This leaking of energy also results in a quicker dissipation of ionization, granting ships with these crystals some resistance against the occasional ion storms that occur in the Waste."
